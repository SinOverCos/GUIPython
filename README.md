# GUIPython
First GUI project, done with Kivy.

Some issues encountered along the way:
kivy tree is constructed at the beginning, but also can't rely on the whole tree being present when some custom-made constructors run



 deleting multiple stamps




making imgaes behave like buttons (draggin the toch)

mention/explain all the things in the future todo setcton


widget tree indices and children indices
